# Kalender

This is a calendar app I created during the first year of my computer science studies. I won't defend the quality of the code, 
but I was, and still am, very proud of it and use it as my personal day to day calendar.

It has all the most basic functionality you can expect from a calendar like personal accounts, categories for planning your
activities, and the possibillity to subscribe to third party calendars by providing a url.

Here's a picture of the calendars month view on a mock profile:

Here's a picture of the day view from the same profile.
